📌 Project Overview

This project evaluates whether nutritional counseling during antenatal care (ANC) is associated with timely initiation of breastfeeding (TIBF)—defined as breastfeeding within the first hour after birth—among Ethiopian women using the 2016 EDHS dataset.

This repository demonstrates a full epidemiologic data analysis workflow in SAS, including:

Importing raw DHS data

Recoding variables and constructing analytical datasets

Applying complex survey design (weights, strata, clusters)

Producing weighted descriptive statistics

Conducting Rao–Scott chi-square tests

Building survey-weighted logistic regression models (crude & adjusted)

Preparing results for manuscript reporting
